description: >-
  This is an general-purpose action recognition model for Kinetics-400 dataset.
  The model uses Video Transformer approach with ResNet34 encoder. Please refer
  to the kinetics <https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-datasets/kinetics/>
  dataset specification to see list of action that are recognised by this model.

  This model is only decoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts stack of frame
  embeddings, computed by action-recognition-0001-encoder, and produces prediction
  on input video. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second fragment (i.e.
  skip every second frame in 30 fps video).
